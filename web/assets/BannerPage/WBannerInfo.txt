Weapon Name: A Thousand Floating Dreams
Rarity: 5
Description: This is a 5-star catalyst which scales off of Elemental Mastery as its substat. Its passive, in summary, gives off Elemental Mastery or Elemental Type damage boost to teammates.
Opinion: This is a very powerful weapon, but a niche one meant for those who scale from Elemental Mastery like Nahida, Sucrose, or even Kokomi.

Weapon Name: Thundering Pulse
Rarity: 5
Description: This is a 5-star bow which scales off of Crit Dmg as its substat. Its passive boosts Atk from the get-go and gives normal attack bonus Dmg based on the stacks the character has.
Opinion: This weapon is a very good stat-stick, as it gives off great base attack boost and scales with Crit Dmg, but it shines especially well for normal attackers, as this weapon also gives normal attack damage boost.

Weapon Name: Rust
Rarity: 4
Description: This 4-star bow scales off of Atk% as its substat, but has a simple passive that increases Normal Attack DMG% that increases with refinement, at the cost of decreasing Charged Attack DMG%.
Opinion: This weapon is most especially useful for bow-users who mainly use normal attacks like Childe and Yoimiya. However, this weapon is highly discouraged for those who use charged attacks, like Ganyu.

Weapon Name: The Flute
Rarity: 4
Description: A 4-star sword which scales off of Atk% as its substat, this weapon has a passive which deals damage around the equipping character after gaining 5 stacks from normal or charged attacks.
Opinion: A generally overshadowed weapon due to its dull passive, this weapon can easily be replaced by weapons with better stats, or even better passives, but can be used in niche scenarios like a normal attacker Qiqi.

Weapon Name: The Widsith
Rarity: 4
Description: A 4-star catalyst which scales off of Crit Dmg as its substat, its passive varies between boosting Atk%, Elemental Dmg%, or Elemental Mastery which is decided upon by chance.
Opinion: A very versatile weapon which can be used from a wide range of DPS, Sub-DPS, and even Support characters due to its passive and stats. The fact that this weapon is a 4-star only signifies that its already formidable passive can even be greater with refinements.

Weapon Name: Favonius Lance
Rarity: 4
Description:  A 4-star spear which scales off of Energy Recharge as its substat, its passive is similar to other weapons in the Favonius series, granting a chance (that increases with refinement) of white orbs that restore energy to the character on the field after a critical hit.
Opinion: A low-cost weapon that is very much versatile, thanks to its passive, and useful for characters not too conscious about their offensive stats, commonly being Sub-DPS and Support characters like Rosaria and Zhongli.

Weapon Name: Sacrificial Greatsword
Rarity: 4
Description: A 4-star claymore which scales off of Energy Recharge as its substat, its passive is similar to other weapons in the Sacrificial series, granting a chance (that increases with refinement) to reset an Elemental Skill's cooldown after hitting an opponent.
Opinion: An interesting, but niche weapon that can be used by a few characters like Chongyun. Unlike other weapons of the same Sacrificial series, this one is particularly replaceable by a more powerful/useful weapon like Wolf's Gravestone or even Prototype Archaic.
